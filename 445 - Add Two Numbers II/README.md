## Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Example 1:

Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]

## Personal Notes

I had to doublecheck and see how reversing the lists worked but overall it was a nice task that built on the
previous linked list tasks! Linked lists after all this still feel a bit foreign...
 
Am i a linked list professional now? No
Did i learn some stuff? Yes!
So i would still count it as a win

Also, I made and editted these files and folders all with the bash terminal, isnt that cool? Thanks nano
