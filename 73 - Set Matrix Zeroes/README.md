## Description

Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.

You must do it in place.

Example 1:

![Example 1 Picture](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/mat1.jpg)

Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

## Personal Notes

I doublechecked after i made my submission but I misunderstood how "in place" works, I thought it simply meant not making a copy of the input
but by creating the 2 Lists that hold the coordinations of all Zeroes I already broke that rule. 

Will revisit this later today or tomorrow when I have time
