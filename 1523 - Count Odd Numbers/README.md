## Description

Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).


Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].


## Personal Notes

My first submission works fine but takes some time when the input is large enough. 

The second submission is by solving it with if else statements and calculating
the amount of Odd Numbers myself instead of running a loop through
