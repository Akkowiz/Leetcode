## Description

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

## Personal Notes

I ran into a small issue because I forgot that strings are 0-indexed too
In the reviewed version I added comments to the while loops, to make it more clear what is going on
